      <Center><h4>Let's talk about the two primary purposes of a secure HTTPS connection,Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is a protocol that secures communication and data transfer between a user's web browser and a website. HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP.The protocol protects users against eavesdroppers and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.A MITM attacks are a common type of cybersecurity attack that allows attackers to eavesdrop on the communication between two targets.The risk of these cyberattacks is it gives the attacker the  ability to get sensitive personal information -- such as login credentials, account details or credit card numbers. A HTTPS Proxy Appliance is a request/response protocol between clients and servers used for secure communications and transactions.How is this possible ? Many years ago, the people at Netscape who developed the first popular web browser, invented a solution to both the need for Internet privacy (encryption) and security (authentication). Their concept was elegant and simple and has endured to this day: A third party who we trust has assured us that our encrypted traffic is going only to the website we intend. Here how that works:There are entities known as "Certificate Authorities" (CA) to whom web sites prove their identity in the real physical world using incorporation documentation, Dun & Bradstreet records, their publicly known telephone numbers, and so forth. When a web site has proven its identity with sufficient certainty, the Certificate Authority (CA) will put its reputation on the line by digitally signing the site's security certificate which contains an assertion of its identity. (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure,Rahul Awati)
          <p> What is a SSL and how can interception be prevented? And detected ? SSL or TLS (“Secure Sockets Layer” and “Transport Layer Security”) two names for the same thing. What's significant is that the data sent back and forth over any HTTPS/SSL/TLS connection is encrypted by technology no one knows how to break. Really, no one. It's truly secure.(Fingerprints,Steve Gibson)
	  <p>A hash is complex mathematical algorithms which carefully process every single bit of what they “digest.” They have the amazingly property that if even one bit inside the certificate is changed, an average of half of the fingerprint's hash bits will change in response! In other words, when such a cryptographic hash is used to “fingerprint” a certificate any change, no matter how small, will result in a COMPLETELY different fingerprint.(Fingerprints,Steve Gibso)
	  <p>A false positive is when you input 2 different websites that are spelled differently,But its the same website,So the fingerprint is the same.This is a false positive because you think you have the right fingerprint,but in reality you have an entirely wrong fingerprint.(Fingerprints,Steve Gibson)
	  <p> I don’t think my School/Gov should have the right to eavesdrop on my  communications,Because that is a breach of my cyber security and privacy. The only thing that should be able to do is  the website I allow it to, No other third party should.
