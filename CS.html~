      <center><h3>Well Well Well,Let me tell you about CS1.It was one of the hardest classes I have taken but the most rewarding one. I felt soooo good everytime I did the missions and made the games work right. At the end I loved it, I learned SO much from the class. some of the best things I learned were how to use emacs and compliers, operating systems, and algorithms. At the end of the year I got the chance to make a small game (If you want to know more about the go to my ISP link) which was great I loved it. I had the freedom to make what i want and it also give me a chance to put what i have learned through the year to work,it was AMAZING. If you are considering taking CS1 I would very much recommend it !!!     </h3></center>
